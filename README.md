This is a deep learning model for predicting earthquake occurrences based on real-time data. The model utilizes various data sources, including seismic activity, weather patterns, and geological data, to provide accurate and timely predictions.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need to have the following software installed:

- Python (3.7 or higher)
- TensorFlow (2.0 or higher)
- Keras (2.3 or higher)
- NumPy (1.17 or higher)
- Matplotlib (3.1 or higher)

### Installation
To install the required packages, run the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Usage

To train the model, run the following command:

```
python train.py
```

This will generate a trained model in the model directory.

To make predictions using the model, run the following command:

```
python predict.py
```

This will generate earthquake predictions based on real-time data.
